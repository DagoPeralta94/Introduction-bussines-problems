He hasn't decided yet on the location, and he has asked me to provide a suggestion what the best location is.\n\nThe best location in this case is related to other venues in the vincinity that attract customers. This could be restaurants, parks, university faculties, companies. But also the lack of other coffee-venues in the area.\n\n<H3>Data selection and requirements</H3>\n\nTo answer the questions, I want to source data from Foursquare. To do the analysis I will use Jupyter notebooks and python 3.7. Libraries I'm going to use include map-visualization, analytical libraries and libraries that make it convenient to work with datasets.\n\nTo answer the question for the customer, I want to create lists of different types of venues. Once I have categorized and clustered them, I want to plot them on a map. Based on this, I want to be able to show the best area for the coffee-shop to be opened.\n\n<H2>Section 2 - Data</H2>",
